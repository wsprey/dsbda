Provide summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for \n","a dataset (age, income etc.) with numeric variables grouped by one of the qualitative \n","(categorical) variable. For example, if your categorical variable is age groups and \n","quantitative variable is income, then provide summary statistics of income grouped by the \n","age groups.
